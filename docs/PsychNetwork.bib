	abstract = {Recently, researchers in clinical psychology have endeavored to create network models of the relationships between symptoms, both within and across mental disorders. Symptoms that connect two mental disorders are called "bridge symptoms." Unfortunately, no formal quantitative methods for identifying these bridge symptoms exist. Accordingly, we developed four network statistics to identify bridge symptoms: bridge strength, bridge betweenness, bridge closeness, and bridge expected influence. These statistics are nonspecific to the type of network estimated, making them potentially useful in individual-level psychometric networks, group-level psychometric networks, and networks outside the field of psychopathology such as social networks. We first tested the fidelity of our statistics in predicting bridge nodes in a series of simulations. Averaged across all conditions, the statistics achieved a sensitivity of 92.7\% and a specificity of 84.9\%. By simulating datasets of varying sample sizes, we tested the robustness of our statistics, confirming their suitability for network psychometrics. Furthermore, we simulated the contagion of one mental disorder to another, showing that deactivating bridge nodes prevents the spread of comorbidity (i.e., one disorder activating another). Eliminating nodes based on bridge statistics was more effective than eliminating nodes high on traditional centrality statistics in preventing comorbidity. Finally, we applied our algorithms to 18 group-level empirical comorbidity networks from published studies and discussed the implications of this analysis.},

	abstract = {Jones, Ma, and McNally (2019) introduce a novel network measure called bridge centrality, which aims to quantify psychopathological symptoms that may contribute to comorbidity. Centrality measures in psychometric networks have come under scrutiny recently with several researchers arguing for more explicit interpretations of what they purport to measure. One useful strategy has been to connect centrality measures to more traditional psychometric measures such as factor loadings. In this commentary, we aim to do the same by connecting bridge centrality to a recently developed measure called network loadings, which are roughly equivalent with factor loadings. By re-analyzing a recent simulation study, we demonstrate that bridge centrality (specifically bridge strength and bridge expected influence) are nothing more than the (absolute) sum of network cross-loadings. We provide an empirical example to demonstrate this equivalency as well as to show some potential shortcomings of bridge centrality when there are more than two disorders in a network. We raise concerns over bridge centrality’s utility and recommend researchers use network loadings instead.},

	abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated that the network measure node strength or sum of a node’s connections is roughly equivalent to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) loadings. A key finding of this research is that node strength represents a combination of different latent causes. In the present research, we sought to circumvent this issue by formulating a network equivalent of factor loadings, which we call network loadings. In two simulations, we evaluated whether these network loadings could effectively (1) separate the effects of multiple latent causes and (2) estimate the simulated factor loading matrix of factor models. Our findings suggest that the network loadings can effectively do both. In addition, we leveraged the second simulation to derive effect size guidelines for network loadings. In a third simulation, we evaluated the similarities and differences between factor and network loadings when the data were generated from random, factor, and network models. We found sufficient differences between the loadings, which allowed us to develop an algorithm to predict the data generating model called the Loadings Comparison Test (LCT). The LCT had high sensitivity and specificity when predicting the data generating model. In sum, our results suggest that network loadings can provide similar information to factor loadings when the data are generated from a factor model and therefore can be used in a similar way (e.g., item selection, measurement invariance, factor scores).},

	abstract = {Network approaches to psychometric constructs, in which constructs are modeled in terms of interactions between their constituent factors, have rapidly gained popularity in psychology. Applications of such network approaches to various psychological constructs have recently moved from a descriptive stance, in which the goal is to estimate the network structure that pertains to a construct, to a more comparative stance, in which the goal is to compare network structures across populations. However, the statistical tools to do so are lacking. In this article, we present the network comparison test (NCT), which uses resampling-based permutation testing to compare network structures from two independent, cross-sectional data sets on invariance of (a) network structure, (b) edge (connection) strength, and (c) global strength. Performance of NCT is evaluated in simulations that show NCT to perform well in various circumstances for all three tests: The Type I error rate is close to the nominal significance level, and power proves sufficiently high if sample size and difference between networks are substantial. We illustrate NCT by comparing depression symptom networks of males and females. Possible extensions of NCT are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Gaussian graphical models (GGM; “networks”) allow for estimating conditional dependence structures that are encoded by partial correlations. This is accomplished by identifying non-zero relations in the inverse of the covariance matrix. In psychology the default estimation method uses ℓ1-regularization, where the accompanying inferences are restricted to frequentist objectives. Bayesian methods remain relatively uncommon in practice and methodological literatures. To date, they have not yet been used for estimation and inference in the psychological network literature. In this work, I introduce Bayesian methodology that is specifically designed for the most common psychological applications. The graphical structure is determined with posterior probabilities that can be used to assess conditional dependent and independent relations. Additional methods are provided for extending inference to specific aspects within- and between-networks, including partial correlation differences and Bayesian methodology to quantify network predictability. I first demonstrate that the decision rule based on posterior probabilities can be calibrated to the desired level of specificity. The proposed techniques are then demonstrated in several illustrative examples. The methods have been implemented in the R package BGGM.},
